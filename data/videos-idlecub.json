To survive the monster onslaught on each tower's level, you'll need to obtain and carefully organize weapons and accessories in your inventory.\n\nThe world was once a bright and beautiful place, filled with light and wonder. But one day, an evil force swept across the land, stealing away the world's light and plunging it into darkness.
