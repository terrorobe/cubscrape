The Elvish Orb gives +1 Multicast to an Elven item - permanently, not temporarly. For that it needs 12 seconds and that's the biggest issue, to either survive that long or to not kill the enemies prior to it triggering. And that's the real issue, even though it may sound nice to destroy the enemies, at one point you will get overpowered and die so fast that Elvish Orb also can't trigger, going into a cycle of repeated losses until the game is over. So the plan is simple: Get Lost Fragment below an optimally upgraded Elvish Orb so it will double trigger, giving +4 Multicast immediately, which is usually enough to win the game or at least to get very far.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players.

It would be too much to put everything in here, but how about: Bouncing enemy projectiles, 5 times the damage and no healing is dropped? Yea, that sounds quite insane and is just a small part of the package. This time I am not allowed to make use of the \"reroll banish exploit\", or how I would call it: Using our brain. The \"exploit\" allows you to banish everything you roll through at once, so you are left with mostly legendary and mythical upgrades. Jokes aside, this does make the run a lot harder and/or a lot more serious, so there is left space to goof around and it shows in the final boss fight.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One\n\u2022DLC on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900140/Bounty_of_One__Panic_in_the_Mines/\n\n#bountyofone #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

With the Elven Orb we stack a ton of multicast on it, but one thing is missing: actual damage. So we take the Elven book to increase it's damage AND we multicast said book to multiply the damage faster and faster. In the second run we go for a more typical multicast with the Lunar Codex, slap a bunch of potions on it and since it now has bleed, we can combine it with Shardfang - a legendary dagger that attacks whenever we apply bleed (which we do a ton per attack), and helps us deal a lot more damage until Warhorn kicks in and explodes the damage of Lunar Codex.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players.

      "description": "\u2735Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEnz2EwvYH7COFhHaKCiYIbqEaN0F9uh9\nToday on the DLC for Brotato Abyssal Terrors I take on a challenge I was working on for a while: Win on Danger 5 with 0 items. At first this doesn't sound that bad, but each character I attempted this with struggled at different points - mostly against some of the later waves, the Elite or the final boss fight, but for different reasons. Loud for example can build up a lot of Attack Speed, but most runs ended rather early since it becomes insanely difficult to survive the enemies without healing from material or buying armor and melee damage items. Another problem with these challenges is that I may have the best character but due to a few unlucky runs I stop playing them. Today I went for Vagabond for the first time after getting too frustrated that I always had a few good stats but others were completely lacking, ending in a loss - and Vagabond let's all weapons count as every class so you get max bonuses from each weapon class equipped. While this does compensate for a lack of general stats, it relies a ton on what weapons you find and what level up stats you get to round up your build.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Reaching high damage numbers in Brotato is not hard to achieve if you go for Endless Mode, but the moment you get limited to just 20 waves you have way less options - and need way better RNG - to reach enough damage to one shot the bosses. How much? 33,206 Damage. So what's the plan? The rough plan is to get Obliterator as it's 1500% Ranged Damage scaling is the most absurd damage scaling on any weapon in the game, Cursed this can be up to 3150%. With a Crit that deals x2.3 damage, that goes up to 7245% Damage scaling, all of which lowers the Ranged Damage and %Damage requirement. So the plan is simple, but finding what you may as well call Exodia is what makes this so hard. Even if you find all the damage pieces, without enough economy you won't be able to get enough Ranged and %Damage, so a lot has to work out right.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Don't get me wrong, every weapon could be focused on in Arena and we could make some fun builds, and maybe one day I will continue especially when the update comes around, but I think for now I am done after having a huge blast on my own, of which I shared a bunch with you guys.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238670/Conquest_Dark/\n\n#conquestdark #roguelike #bulletheaven #DexTag #gaming",

Yea I played quite a bit on my own and we do this here to farm up resources. But today I want to go for an endless run in the arena of Conquest Dark and attempt a theory I had for an immortal build. It relies on dodges - not dashes, those are a separate thing - as dodges avoid a normal hit on you. I say normal because I know of 2 exceptions, but we won't encounter these. Now that sounds fine and good, but we'd run out of dodge charges right? Wrong, that's where we use the Artifact Edge of Darkness, which has a 10% chance (affected by proc chance bonuses) to refill ALL of your dodge charges hit a single hit. So I want to focus on multi-attacks and attack speed on our primary weapon as much as possible that we can be as safe as possible.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238670/Conquest_Dark/\n\n#conquestdark #roguelike #bulletheaven #DexTag #gaming",

I'd say it's best to watch the video, I tried to cut it short that everything is rather quickly revelead, but as a small tip: Multiplicative multipliers is the keyword. Additive multipliers are something like crit damage, where you deal x2 damage, if you increase that you can deal x3, x4, x5, the point is the actual multiplicative damage is being added on top of. But multiplicative multipliers go from x2 to x4 to x8 to x16 and so on.

Now I define a win as getting to 0 minutes since this then spawns the endless waves, meaning you made it through the game and are now on a timer to die. That said, if you think a win would be a boss kill, I totally understand that - and the main reason I didn't even mention that in the video is that I simply haven't thought about it, since you can do the boss kill at any point or even never, but hitting 0 is always guaranteed to happen. So for me the boss is rather an additional thing. To say this challenge was tough would be an understatement and when you see the winning run you'll understand what was needed to get there.

The claw is...well, you gotta look at it honestly. For the item, it deals damage based on the amount of duplicates in the machine. Sounds weak, but the character also duplicates whatever is used as last item when the last fight was one - INCLUDING golden verisons. I gotta say this run felt like a huge amount of fun and I really enjoyed these additions, the character/experience was easily a 9/10.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Farmer gains Harvesting per consumable picked up at full HP and also increases the end of round Harvesting bonus from 5% to 8%. Entrepreneur may not initially strike one as a part of the trio, but he reduces prices by 25% to buy more and scale faster while also increasing Harvesting bonuses by 50%! Yes, that's a huge chunk. And Baby reduces prices by another 20%, so we can buy even more, while also providing us with a total of 24 weapon slots, meaning 24 cursed gardens that at the same time increase in damage the more Harvesting we have. One Brotato I banished was Druid, just because Druid on his own is already insanely broken and the run would rather deviate away from being about Harvesting into being about just fruits, as you have a chance to gain Luck per fruit picked up. Which is crazy, don't get me wrong, but not really the goal of this.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

After starting off with a poison potion that can triple poison on the enemy, I decided to ask you guys if you want to go for a reset-run, meaning we quit out if we don't get something good and do it again. That said, just because that can be done doesn't change that much. As in yes, you can reset for what you want if it's there, but the game highly limits what's available.

In our case we went crazy and hit 52% Damage per 10 Luck, or in other words 52 Pearls worth of Cursed Pearls.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

But I didn't realize yet that the main trickster is on it's way: Yorick. Not just 1, but 2. Yorick multiplies the multiplier, which increases by 1 every 23 discards - meaning now every 23 discards we increase it twice by 1.

Thanks to you guys we figured out 2 crucial elements of the game, for starters as long as nothing is chosen in the starter sheriff chest, I can just alt+F4 to start a new run that still has the chest - usually you have to beat the first Sheriff and quit out to get it. This makes resetting for the right starting object WAY faster. Second, and more importantly, one of you has figured out that rolling and then banishing all choices does not just banish the current choices, but also the ones we rolled over. So if the stars align and we (finally, because this took several tries) get just the right rolls to banish the things we don't want, we are just left with insane mythical upgrades.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One\n\u2022DLC on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900140/Bounty_of_One__Panic_in_the_Mines/\n\n#bountyofone #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Now each strategy or build has its own strengths and weaknesses, but it mostly depends what they are for - in this case, it's for Endless only, mostly since it's a bit difficult to get everything in time. Don't get me wrong, you can still beat Danger 5 Classic Brotato with it as shown here, but it's way harder than some other strategies. So what do we do? We spam turrets. Romantic has a chance to charm enemies with each hit he lands once they reach 25% HP - this also includes the damage turrets deal. So the plan is to get a ton of turrets with a ton of attack speed, proc Giant's Belt like stupid and then charm them to finish them off.

It may surprise some given the usual games I cover, but I really enjoy city-builders for a long time now and at one point decided to do all achievements whenever I play one, which means I also end up playing and trying out a lot of things. Today I make use of an exploit I discovered that allows us to (almost) infinitely scale up selling values and lowering buying prices, to absolutely ridiculous and absurd levels where it becomes impossible to build up our treasury fast enough to keep all the money stored. \n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#foundation #citybuilder #DexTag #gaming",

      "description": "\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2307170/Everwarder/\nToday we check out Everwarder, a very fun game that is best described by taking Dome Keeper, minimizing mining and maximizing tower defense. You spawn in a randomly generated area and have to place down Crystals to mine out the surrounding area. Whenever a block is mined, an enemy spawns and wants to attack your Crystal, which is your base you have to protect. Enemies have 3 different types, indicated by their spawn area, and the game follows a simple rock-paper-scissor-principle, where a tower can deal 2x, 1x or 0.5x damage based on it's own and the enemy type. As we dig through the enemy blocks we also discover artifact fragments, once 5 are collected we get to choose an artifact. These will give the tower it's meant for a special effect, while the others receive an increase to their Gem amount - and Gems are what determine how strong an upgrade is for that tower. So eventually you have to decide if you want to give your main tower a special effect, or if you want to instead get one for another tower but it will give more gems to the main tower, which then upgrades all the other upgrades you have unlocked for it.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2307170/Everwarder/\n\n#everwarder #autobattler #towerdefense #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Not that we could though since we only deal 1 damage and with our insanely negative %Damage, there is also no fast way to change that. While playing I got quite surprised how the run felt quite good, like a normal character would. It's pretty much just a Pacifist run but removes a lot of frustration and replaces it with fun. The map is bigger and a minigame is added to avoid all trees. Once enough spawned, the additional healing from Cryptid (3 HP Regeneration per Tree) keeps us alive. But there is a tipping point - the Giants Belt. This must be one of the most hilarious things I personally experienced in Brotato, seeing our weapon deal a miniscule amount of damage but slapping the enemies out of existence due to the Giants Belt effect.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\nGmo2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3340744902\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Without stat level ups, you lack so many stats that you build up over time that it's hard to make anything work that's not completely broken (like Sticks).\n\nSUPERMARKET: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358630815\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

To say this should be the go-to strategy for Jack is definitely wrong, you may be doing very well and all of a sudden you stand on a wave with no weapons left or just find none to refill those that you lost. But when it works out it's so much fun.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

While the start is very simple due to his high HP, HP Regeneration and Armor bonus, it is rather quickly noticed that the increasing enemy damage starts becoming a problem since you need to get hit to explode to kill enemies. Probably the best way by far to deal with that is the Blood Donation - an item that gives you 40 Harvesting, but more importantly deals 1 damage to you per second, meaning the explosion gets triggered without the need of running into enemies, though to burst down strong enemies it can still be done to trigger several explosions a second. We also find another favorite item of mine on him, the Handcuffs. If the goal is just to beat the game, then the Handcuffs are one of the best item on him as long as you determine that you already have enough HP, so the later you find it the better. While it locks your HP, it also gives you 24 damage stats, which the ability of Bull multiplies by 3 - so 72 - and is further increased by %Damage and %Explosion Damage bonuses.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

I was asked to do a Curse only run and after several not so fun attempts, I decided to give in and use the Cursed Characters mod, a mod that improves the upsides and decreases the downsides of every character. In our case this means we have overall better scaling, but the best thing is that we start with 2 cursed fishing hooks having a 28% chance to curse (each), and that our character looks cursed instead of normal. This does mean we won't be able to get to 100% Curse chance, but hey it's an amazing buff to the start. As we get through the run, one issue becomes apparent, which is that we struggle building up the right items compared to a normal run - so where a normal run curses e.g. all Tardigrades in the shop, you still get a huge amount out of crates. We don't. And worse: All the bad limited or unique items I just pick up to get them out of the way, this time I have to wait for them to appear and then waste a round to curse them.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\nCursed Characters: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3354385962\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/HereIsDex\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Paws contain the main effect of the character it's from and any character can use any paws, a total of 3. So in our case we could retain a total of 300% Block: 50% from the character, 150% from 3x his paw, 100% from the Perk. But while the infinite scaling is nice, the real issue is the very first turn, where we need to make sure to reach enough Block to even survive. So for that I removed one of his paws to replace it with a paw that gives us a Harpoon - an insane Claw that double uses anything it picks up.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

We start with a main tower that has our health, each time it gets destroyed losing one, or instantly losing if a boss takes it down. So we have to put a bunch of towers in the way to make sure all enemies are being defeated. But that sounds too simple and boring - what if we use infinitely scaling damage and health growth?

      "description": "\u2735Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEnz2EwvYH7COFhHaKCiYIbqEaN0F9uh9\nSince Brotato received it's DLC Abyssal Terrors, one thing was imminent: that I would do another no movement challenge to beat the new map. In the past, we beat the old map on Danger 0 with the Bull https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6mHpZSYRaQ and Danger 5 with Soldier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uq4bO2Dfe0\nToday I decided to skip Danger 0 and jump right into Danger 5 and attempt to beat it yet again with the Soldier, a character that gains bonus stats and especially a huge amount of pickup range, just while standing still. While this run makes it look relatively simple - aside from the near death encounters - I would highly suggest everyone gives this a try to see just how much more difficult it has become on the new map. More ranged enemies, more dashers, cursed enemies receive a huge buff and almost no Elites allow to continue. But the one big new thing we have on our side is Curse, a mechanic that allows weapons and items to receive a multiplier to their stats, while also reducing negatives. Now if you ask me how we managed to win, I am honestly not exactly sure. It definitely relied on a specific item related to dodging, but I would haven ever expected that it would be enough to win.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Though I want to take it a step further, I want to have as much Bait as possible. The difference? I won't shop and buy items that would be good, instead I want to use all of my money to roll and get more Bait. To achieve that we also implement a strategy to lock cheap weapons and items to get a free reroll - which happens when you empty out the shop. Free rerolls do not progress the reroll cost in the game, that means every reroll we save will save us a high cost reroll at the end - as long as what we spend on the items & weapons to buy is not higher than those reroll costs or rather the accumulated increase (if every reroll costs 5 more Material, then we save 5 Material on every future reroll we do, so it's not as simple as just looking the final cost).\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\n@ChaoticVice777 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muAZ4UjPg2A\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

While my mind is first excited about the possibility to have so many weapons, I quickly come to the realization that this also means that we will have 33 level ups without stat bonuses.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The premise is quite simple: At the end of the wave, you turn 50% of your Material but divided by 13 into Health, so if you have 260 Material, 130/13=10 Health. The twist is that the character uses Health to buy things in the shop, meaning any other health bonuses you get is money. So if you use the Ghost Scepter that give you bonus health by killing enemies, you not only get money from killing, but also from getting more health.\nThe video referenced where we used Demon to hit wave 1000 that also explains a lot more on how to setup the run: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvHETTCk86E\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

All in all I think Curious might actually be one of my favorite characters balance wise as you constantly have to decide whether or not the penalty is worth it - and also need to plan how to deal with it if you risk it.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The payoff for the struggle is that all the level up stats are doubled, so instead of 20% damage we would gain 40% damage if we find a legendary damage level up.

The moment the timer runs out and we get into the level-up screen and shopping phase, I can remove the blindfold to make proper decisions. While this run may make it look relatively simple, this was actually the 17th or 18th run I attempted.

While I initially thought this would just be a slight additional that sometimes helps, it turned out to be a hilarious way of playing the game - hitting 1 enemy and causing a chain explosion that wipes out entire countries. The only issue is that the explosion scales negatively with Attack Speed, meaning if you want to play into the theme of the character, then you don't want to have Attack Speed or even decrease it, which is honestly fine for the normal game, but the moment we hit Endless a quick decline is expected.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

      "description": "\u2735Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEnz2EwvYH7COFhHaKCiYIbqEaN0F9uh9\nToday on the new DLC for Brotato Abyssal Terrors we play the Hiker, overall a very interesting character that only receives half the material but makes that up by earning material the more you walk - except there are a few issues. For starters, the Hiker starts with -15% Speed, or rather -16.5% since Speed changes are increased by 10%. This means that you either go for the Jousting Lance or you focus on buffing up Speed to manage to survive the dashy and spammy enemy hordes. That's already where the first issue kicks in - since the Hiker gains half Material, we level up way less, and the material we earn by running around does not give experience. For comparison, Baby - a character that requires 200% more XP to level up - ends usually on level 23. We ended on level 16. So this is not a small thing that has a slight impact, but a major one since Speed is also mainly gained through level up choices. The character also gains bonus HP from running around and that one is fine or even too good, since you don't really have to care about HP anymore. I mean don't get me wrong, the way the character is he needs the HP bonus as it is, but I think it would be a lot more fun if steps would be increased to 100 or even 120, but the loss in Material is reduced to -25% or even removed - and the -15% Speed makes it extremely hard to play any other weapon but the Jousting Lance, so removing that would make the character a lot more fun.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

I will state that I had far worse experiences with some other characters, but what makes him so horrible for me is that he takes the normal amount of RNG Brotato has (and it's quite high already) and multiplies that by a levels. My general strategy with him is to pick up as many items as possible that have a global effect, so something that would affect all weapons or help myself survive. I prefer killing over survivability, but this depends on what option I get. In this case I found the Sausage early on, so I knew we will always get value out of Elemental Damage, and that spiraled a bit out of control by assembling a perfect Turret build creation.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Prior, a 20% increase would mean you went from 300% experience gain to 320%, a tiny increase.

To my own surprise, the run turned out to be very simple on normal waves, though the Elites and final bossfight were huge issues.

In good old fashion we can't just normally play the game and instead I wrote down every weapon that exists in the game, put it into an Excel sheet and figured out a few builds that allow you to make use of 12 different traits - that's what the Vagabond is all about. He can't have the same weapon multiple times, but each weapon counts for every trait, so a weapon like the SMG being a Gun still counts for the Slingshot trait Primitive, so if someone has these 2 weapons then Primitive and Gun will both be at level 2. For a while everything works out according to the plan - and honestly way better than expected - but then it took a steep turn as I came across Excalibur, a legendary weapon. Which also has the Legendary trait that reduces HP by 20. But due to Vagabonds special ability, it's right away maxed out at -100, while also reducing armor by 18.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Since One Armed only has 1 weapon he has a lot less potential compared to other characters, as in he is a lot more limited - and that sadly also means that luck will play a bigger factor with him, since you can have a hard time getting the right weapons and upgrading yours.\nThe shown strategy is meant to counter this a bit by giving you insane Damage, so more weapons become viable, but it has a new weakness that you have to find a weapon to replace the Axe. I would recommend locking a weapon you want around wave 7/8, so you can buy it immediately after wave 9. I chose Shurikens here because I had a lot of Melee Damage, but without that I could have went for the SMG, Slingshot or pretty much anything that I scale up quickly with the double damage scaling and a starting 200% Damage boost.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Since there were a bunch of new Arcanas with the introduction of Darkasso we are able to take it to whole new extremes, however we are sadly more limited than it seems. Initially I planned to go for Bolero and did so, but since we need 2 scaling Arcanas as fast as possible, Bolero actually backfires and hurts us. With Inverse Mode we can guarantee to get 4 Arcanas, but with Bolero we are at the mercy of random spawns whether we will get them in time or not. To understand, we need Silent Old Sanctuary, Wicked Season and Boogaloo of Illusions. Meaning we could reset the stage until we spawn with 1 and reset until there is also one on the 1st minute, but that will take a huge amount of time to achieve and just for a chance at additional Arcanas. So I determined in this case it's not worth it and we will play it the regular way, but of course while also making use of the new Arcana Sapphire Mist, that allows us to multi-trigger weapons. It doesn't matter for Santa Water at all, pretty much, but our scaling will be way higher thanks to it, since it multi-triggers Paranormal Scan - each time giving us a random stat boost, of which we mostly look for Might.\n\nVS Mod used: https://www.nexusmods.com/vampiresurvivors/mods/87?tab=description\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

Before the run I did consider what I want to do, but the plan was rather rough: Get the magnetic claw combined with Count Clawcula, since that means we can do very quick and large grabs to attack. The lifesteal will keep as alive as long as we don't lose in a single big attack. On level ups I wanted to have at least 1 magnet, but the rest is just whatever metallic thing we can get that is not too big - the last thing we want to have is issues with big metallic weapons and the magnet, for example that it gets stuck or just due to size causes items to fall off.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

If you asked me whether this was possible or not in such a short amount of time, I would have said \"Never\".

I said no. The Piranya is an odd weapon that swims around and eats Fluff, each time increasing it's damage. However, the main difficulty is actually clawing the Piranha to attack the enemies, because it swims around and eats Fluff. All the time. Unless it gets stranded. There also seems to be an odd bug that prevents the Piranha from being thrown back into the item pool, but despite that it was a solid weapon - hopefully getting fixed soon.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The rest of the game will be unchanged though. The Particle Accelerator is a very powerful weapon with infinite pierce that burns the enemies, but also 100% scaling on Elemental Damage and Engineering - both stats that synergize incredibly well with each other, since the Strange Book converts 1 Elemental Damage into 1 Engineering, giving Elemental Damage double value. Another nice effect is that per Engineering, the enemies lose 2% Speed, so you can slow down the enemies or even prevent them from moving while shooting them down.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The Cyborg has a 350% Ranged Damage multiplier, but converts it halfway in a 1:2 ratio into Engineering, which usually makes his ranged weapons - one of which being a Minigun he starts with - useless, however with the Nail we can still use the ridiculous Ranged Damage scaling. Math wise, each point of Ranged Damage is worth 3.5 Ranged Damage, which is then converted into 7 Engineering. 20% of that is then turned into weapon damage, so even at our weakest point we still get 1.4 Ranged Damage out of each point of Ranged Damage we pick up - and since the Minigun is one of if not the fastest firing weapon in the game, it can make perfect use of the stat.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

However, this time we pull out a full financial support, the kind of life support that would keep even the most lost cause alive - Moonlight Bolero forcing a starting Arcana, turning off Inverse Mode and going ham by getting an unreasonable amount of Arcanas. Moonlight Bolero, Silent Old Sanctuary, Wicked Season, Sapphire Mist, Heart of Fire, Jail of Crystal, Crystal Cries. Yes, you heard that right, a total of 7 Arcana were used here and it pains me to say that, but the Tri-Bracelet not only performed well, but it's performance was incredibely on the hard waves.\nOne thing that has to be stated though: In the past we used Inverse Mode to gain a 4th Arcana we would usually not have. The upside is that we scale faster and become stronger, but the 200% bonus HP on the enemies is no joke. Most weapons can deal with this until the hardcore waves appear, but with Moonlight Bolero and a decent amount of luck, this is not a requirement anymore to get an additional Arcana. However, the big downside is that 3 additional Arcana are needed to make it worth it - 1 to re-pay the investment of Moonlight Bolero, 1 to compensate for the loss of the 4th Arcana, and another 1 to actually have more Arcanas than without Moonlight Bolero. Since 1 can be forced in by resetting the game, \"only\" 2 additional Arcana are needed, however it is a gamble whether this actually happens and also when - since getting a growing Arcana at 25 minutes won't help anymore.\n\nVS Mod used: https://www.nexusmods.com/vampiresurvivors/mods/87?tab=description\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

So we combine a character that gains 1 Recovery every level, a weapon that creates a huge amount of chickens (which have their healing multiplied by recovery), a weapon that damages us to get the projectiles and Paranormal Scan, which gives overall stats but also heals - though main purpose is the stats, which also includes Magnet.

The wording is complicated, but pretty much the simple meaning is that nothing that I pick up is allowed to inflict damage on the enemy: So no reflect, no poison, or anything that works in that way. For this I'll use Felina, since we can use her Cat to deal damage to the enemies. If you read this right now: Please let me know in a comment.

      "description": "As an oldschool Pokemon fan, I wanted to give PokeRogue a try after seeing it a couple of times all over YouTube and becoming more and more intrigued by it's design. Little did I know that the game would immediately hook me, up to an extend I'd rather skip sleep to play more.\n\nIf you don't know PokeRogue, just imagine you play Pokemon but skip all the walking. Classic Mode has 200 stages and after each stage, you get to shop, balancing to maintain a healthy team but also not to run out of money. After every 10th stage you get fully healed, but before that either a Boss Pokemon or a Gym battle is waiting, having to carefully balance how much you need for a fight you don't know yet. But the biggest problem of it all: Ivy, your rival. Ivy starts off rather as a sleeper, rarely causing a loss, but she picks up a boss-equivalent Rayquaza that can wipe out entire teams on it's own.\n\nWhile you'd expect the hero of the story would be some very strong Pokemon or a smart abuse of game mechanics, it all came down to an easily forgotten friend.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor \n\u2735Dex' Discord: https://discord.gg/RMUDfuGdNG\n\u2735Game: https://pokerogue.net/\n\n#pokemon #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The plan is quite simple: Crimson Shroud is the only retaliatory weapon in the game that ONLY has retaliatory damage, all other weapons have mixed attack forms, meaning these steal from each other. But this comes at a cost: We have to pick up 1 Health scaling item to evolve Laurel and Crimson Shroud is also a very slow start. And a newly discovered issue: Paranormal Scan keeps giving random stats, including Revivals, so it's actually very beneficial to keep the run going. Crimson Shroud however triggers the White Hand upon killing the Reaper, where you die back to back and can't move at all, meaning way less time to get more Revival stats.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

You'd think that's it, but no, it also deals a ridiculous amount of damage in said huge AOE, and while such weapons usually lack coverage for singular strong enemies made short work of the very powerful Atlanteans on the stage.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor \n\u2735Dex' Discord: https://discord.gg/RMUDfuGdNG\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #contra #operationguns #roguelite #roguelike #gaming #DexTag",

She starts with the weapon Blade Crossbow which evolves into BFC2000-AD (yes I'm not kidding), however the weapon has 2 interesting effects. The first one is that it has a divine intervention effect based on luck, or rather luck increases it's frequency, where a beam appears and she throws shurikens. But more interesting is what seems to be an extreme crit that has several multitudes. My theory is it's based on the enemy HP and less of a random range for crit, but so far I am uncertain.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor \n\u2735Dex' Discord: https://discord.gg/RMUDfuGdNG\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #contra #operationguns #roguelite #roguelike #gaming #DexTag",

The goal was to get an artifact that gives the Lunar Codex 4 bonus damage each time it triggers, but after we couldn't find it and stumbled across the Trigem, I decided to give it a shot. The Trigem gives 5 damage to every item - including non-weapons - when it triggers, the issue is you can't have a duplicate tag, like 2 magic weapons, 2 elven etc. Luckily we randomed into Bat Wing, a legendary bow that gets 3 Multicast at the start of the fight, and round it up with the Astral Hammer, a legendary hammer that has a ton of attacks and usually you want to reduce it's cooldown to 1 second by having 4 Mace equipped. Combined, we have the ultimate Multicast Gods assembled in one build that make heavy use of the bonus damage we stack up.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players. Build deadly combos and scale exponentially.
