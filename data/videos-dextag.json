After hearing a lot of good things about the game, I was quite shocked to see it's mixed rating on Steam - and after playing it for a few rounds, I can't say I understand where that is coming from, though to be fair my experience is limited (so far). The game has beautiful graphics and very interesting systems combined in it, though one issue I noticed is clarity. As a typical Diablo inspired game the theme is rather dark, but that in combination with large animations of weapons makes it hard to clearly identify everything going on. Still, my experience so far has been amazing and I really enjoyed it.\n\nBattle hordes of monsters, acquire new skills, and upgrade your abilities.

We start with a main tower that has our health, each time it gets destroyed losing one, or instantly losing if a boss takes it down. So we have to put a bunch of towers in the way to make sure all enemies are being defeated. But that sounds too simple and boring - what if we use infinitely scaling damage and health growth?

The goal was to get an artifact that gives the Lunar Codex 4 bonus damage each time it triggers, but after we couldn't find it and stumbled across the Trigem, I decided to give it a shot. The Trigem gives 5 damage to every item - including non-weapons - when it triggers, the issue is you can't have a duplicate tag, like 2 magic weapons, 2 elven etc. Luckily we randomed into Bat Wing, a legendary bow that gets 3 Multicast at the start of the fight, and round it up with the Astral Hammer, a legendary hammer that has a ton of attacks and usually you want to reduce it's cooldown to 1 second by having 4 Mace equipped. Combined, we have the ultimate Multicast Gods assembled in one build that make heavy use of the bonus damage we stack up.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players. Build deadly combos and scale exponentially.

While I initially thought this would just be a slight additional that sometimes helps, it turned out to be a hilarious way of playing the game - hitting 1 enemy and causing a chain explosion that wipes out entire countries. The only issue is that the explosion scales negatively with Attack Speed, meaning if you want to play into the theme of the character, then you don't want to have Attack Speed or even decrease it, which is honestly fine for the normal game, but the moment we hit Endless a quick decline is expected.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

In good old fashion we can't just normally play the game and instead I wrote down every weapon that exists in the game, put it into an Excel sheet and figured out a few builds that allow you to make use of 12 different traits - that's what the Vagabond is all about. He can't have the same weapon multiple times, but each weapon counts for every trait, so a weapon like the SMG being a Gun still counts for the Slingshot trait Primitive, so if someone has these 2 weapons then Primitive and Gun will both be at level 2. For a while everything works out according to the plan - and honestly way better than expected - but then it took a steep turn as I came across Excalibur, a legendary weapon. Which also has the Legendary trait that reduces HP by 20. But due to Vagabonds special ability, it's right away maxed out at -100, while also reducing armor by 18.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Just instantly becoming an insane nuke? Technically yes, but the main issue is the rarity of the weapon - and on top of that the Baby is one of the worst characters in the game according to my own subjective feeling.

Though I want to take it a step further, I want to have as much Bait as possible. The difference? I won't shop and buy items that would be good, instead I want to use all of my money to roll and get more Bait. To achieve that we also implement a strategy to lock cheap weapons and items to get a free reroll - which happens when you empty out the shop. Free rerolls do not progress the reroll cost in the game, that means every reroll we save will save us a high cost reroll at the end - as long as what we spend on the items & weapons to buy is not higher than those reroll costs or rather the accumulated increase (if every reroll costs 5 more Material, then we save 5 Material on every future reroll we do, so it's not as simple as just looking the final cost).\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\n@ChaoticVice777 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muAZ4UjPg2A\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

With the Elven Orb we stack a ton of multicast on it, but one thing is missing: actual damage. So we take the Elven book to increase it's damage AND we multicast said book to multiply the damage faster and faster. In the second run we go for a more typical multicast with the Lunar Codex, slap a bunch of potions on it and since it now has bleed, we can combine it with Shardfang - a legendary dagger that attacks whenever we apply bleed (which we do a ton per attack), and helps us deal a lot more damage until Warhorn kicks in and explodes the damage of Lunar Codex.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players.

In the past, we beat the old map on Danger 0 with the Bull https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6mHpZSYRaQ and Danger 5 with Soldier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uq4bO2Dfe0\nToday I decided to skip Danger 0 and jump right into Danger 5 and attempt to beat it yet again with the Soldier, a character that gains bonus stats and especially a huge amount of pickup range, just while standing still. While this run makes it look relatively simple - aside from the near death encounters - I would highly suggest everyone gives this a try to see just how much more difficult it has become on the new map. More ranged enemies, more dashers, cursed enemies receive a huge buff and almost no Elites allow to continue. But the one big new thing we have on our side is Curse, a mechanic that allows weapons and items to receive a multiplier to their stats, while also reducing negatives. Now if you ask me how we managed to win, I am honestly not exactly sure. It definitely relied on a specific item related to dodging, but I would haven ever expected that it would be enough to win.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Now I define a win as getting to 0 minutes since this then spawns the endless waves, meaning you made it through the game and are now on a timer to die. That said, if you think a win would be a boss kill, I totally understand that - and the main reason I didn't even mention that in the video is that I simply haven't thought about it, since you can do the boss kill at any point or even never, but hitting 0 is always guaranteed to happen. So for me the boss is rather an additional thing. To say this challenge was tough would be an understatement and when you see the winning run you'll understand what was needed to get there.

And notably, if you block or dodge an attack, it does not count as a hit. While it started off relatively calm, even the first fun run got the furthest I've ever been. So in the second run I decided to go the build we figured out in the last run including XP, Difficulty and Luck Tome.

What starts out as a greedy take on the game where I want to maximize damage quickly turns out of control as I earn a ridiculous amount of money and buy everything without having to think about it. Eventually I realize that the equivalent to \"Harvesting\" in Brotato, Gathering, triggers every 10 seconds instead of at the end of the wave, the game is completely out of control. The cherry on the top is a combination of skills that allow us to scale up infinite amount of damage and more (honestly, so much I forgot what is all affected) and we don't even need to attack anymore to win. \n\nBook Shooter is a rougelike game that combines many different gameplays. There are a lot of magic, magic books, and enemies in the game. Come and fight!\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551370/Book_Shooter/\n\n#bookshooter #autobattler #hordesurvivor #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Which is probably for the better though, since quite some time went by and allows us to get back into the game properly. So in this video we check out the Berserker, aiming for a double evolution on him to beat the game on Normal mode, the second difficulty level.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820820/Jotunnslayer_Hordes_of_Hel/\n\n#jotunnslayer #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

The Chef is quite an interesting character where enemies have 100% bonus health, but burning enemies take 150% more damage - meaning as long as you can make them burn, they take 25% additional damage. I chose the Stick since they have a very high base damage and are cheap, meaning even without burning the enemies they can deal with most of them, but the moment a boss burns he will get nuked. And the most insane part of it? Cursed Sticks. Sticks gain bonus damage per Stick you have, but the cursed version gains even more damage, potentially even doubling it.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Since One Armed only has 1 weapon he has a lot less potential compared to other characters, as in he is a lot more limited - and that sadly also means that luck will play a bigger factor with him, since you can have a hard time getting the right weapons and upgrading yours.\nThe shown strategy is meant to counter this a bit by giving you insane Damage, so more weapons become viable, but it has a new weakness that you have to find a weapon to replace the Axe. I would recommend locking a weapon you want around wave 7/8, so you can buy it immediately after wave 9. I chose Shurikens here because I had a lot of Melee Damage, but without that I could have went for the SMG, Slingshot or pretty much anything that I scale up quickly with the double damage scaling and a starting 200% Damage boost.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Thanks to you guys we figured out 2 crucial elements of the game, for starters as long as nothing is chosen in the starter sheriff chest, I can just alt+F4 to start a new run that still has the chest - usually you have to beat the first Sheriff and quit out to get it. This makes resetting for the right starting object WAY faster. Second, and more importantly, one of you has figured out that rolling and then banishing all choices does not just banish the current choices, but also the ones we rolled over. So if the stars align and we (finally, because this took several tries) get just the right rolls to banish the things we don't want, we are just left with insane mythical upgrades.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One\n\u2022DLC on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900140/Bounty_of_One__Panic_in_the_Mines/\n\n#bountyofone #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Not that we could though since we only deal 1 damage and with our insanely negative %Damage, there is also no fast way to change that. While playing I got quite surprised how the run felt quite good, like a normal character would. It's pretty much just a Pacifist run but removes a lot of frustration and replaces it with fun. The map is bigger and a minigame is added to avoid all trees. Once enough spawned, the additional healing from Cryptid (3 HP Regeneration per Tree) keeps us alive. But there is a tipping point - the Giants Belt. This must be one of the most hilarious things I personally experienced in Brotato, seeing our weapon deal a miniscule amount of damage but slapping the enemies out of existence due to the Giants Belt effect.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\nGmo2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3340744902\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Traits give you bonuses the more you have of them, some give immediate ones and others require multiple weapons with said trait to unlock it. Imagine Brotato combined with a more fantasy take, also using 6 weapons but with 4 equipment slots. Another big limitation is that everything unlocks over time by leveling up, which is mainly bought in the shop, meaning you can't just go for 6 weapons right away.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2839200/Sleep_Stream/\n\n#sleepstream #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

I was asked to do a Curse only run and after several not so fun attempts, I decided to give in and use the Cursed Characters mod, a mod that improves the upsides and decreases the downsides of every character. In our case this means we have overall better scaling, but the best thing is that we start with 2 cursed fishing hooks having a 28% chance to curse (each), and that our character looks cursed instead of normal. This does mean we won't be able to get to 100% Curse chance, but hey it's an amazing buff to the start. As we get through the run, one issue becomes apparent, which is that we struggle building up the right items compared to a normal run - so where a normal run curses e.g. all Tardigrades in the shop, you still get a huge amount out of crates. We don't. And worse: All the bad limited or unique items I just pick up to get them out of the way, this time I have to wait for them to appear and then waste a round to curse them.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\nCursed Characters: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3354385962\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/HereIsDex\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Today we check out Berserk or Die, a game from Nao Games but published by our beloved Poncle, the team behind Vampire Survivors. In Berserk or Die one message is clear: Destroy your keyboard. The more you smash the harder you strike, using half of your keyboard to attack left and the other half to attack right. While it took some time to get used to it (and some workarounds using the mouse...) I started enjoying the game more and more and hope you also have a blast.\n\nThis is an action game in which players attempt to survive by defeating a number of enemies which appear from the left and right sides of the screen. Use a unique keyboard-banging control scheme for maximum dopamine!

Je-Ne-Viv has a lot of special effects, but the one thing I mainly care about is his 0.5% Curse growth on every level up, in other words tripling the 0.5% every second level up Wicked Season gives. With that the enemies will reach way higher HP levels and thus take more damage to kill them, which is easily dealt with on a weapon that has an instant kill ability. But, as it turns out, this run ended up not being about damage values.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

There are overall so many things introduced, so I will just focus on the key elements. The Sailor specializes in a weapon weapon type called Naval, for which he gains 200% bonus damage against cursed enemies. Curse is a new stat that can randomly increase the strength of an enemy (chance depends on Curse amount), but they also drop additional material. On top of that, Curse gives a chance that an item or weapon gets cursed, giving it bonus stats. As we notice in this run, if this mechanic gets cheesed in the right way, then it turns utterly broken.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Paws contain the main effect of the character it's from and any character can use any paws, a total of 3. So in our case we could retain a total of 300% Block: 50% from the character, 150% from 3x his paw, 100% from the Perk. But while the infinite scaling is nice, the real issue is the very first turn, where we need to make sure to reach enough Block to even survive.

Demon is still very strong, but falls short scaling wise the further you go. Druid on the other hand can increase his damage so ridiculously high with multiplicatively scaling - he makes use of the items that scale with the constantly increasing Luck, so their base damage goes up, but then also converts Luck into %Damage. In our case we went crazy and hit 52% Damage per 10 Luck, or in other words 52 Pearls worth of Cursed Pearls.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

For starters, the Hiker starts with -15% Speed, or rather -16.5% since Speed changes are increased by 10%. This means that you either go for the Jousting Lance or you focus on buffing up Speed to manage to survive the dashy and spammy enemy hordes. That's already where the first issue kicks in - since the Hiker gains half Material, we level up way less, and the material we earn by running around does not give experience. For comparison, Baby - a character that requires 200% more XP to level up - ends usually on level 23. We ended on level 16. So this is not a small thing that has a slight impact, but a major one since Speed is also mainly gained through level up choices. The character also gains bonus HP from running around and that one is fine or even too good, since you don't really have to care about HP anymore. I mean don't get me wrong, the way the character is he needs the HP bonus as it is, but I think it would be a lot more fun if steps would be increased to 100 or even 120, but the loss in Material is reduced to -25% or even removed - and the -15% Speed makes it extremely hard to play any other weapon but the Jousting Lance, so removing that would make the character a lot more fun.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

All in all I think Curious might actually be one of my favorite characters balance wise as you constantly have to decide whether or not the penalty is worth it - and also need to plan how to deal with it if you risk it.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

I said no. The Piranya is an odd weapon that swims around and eats Fluff, each time increasing it's damage. However, the main difficulty is actually clawing the Piranha to attack the enemies, because it swims around and eats Fluff. All the time. Unless it gets stranded. There also seems to be an odd bug that prevents the Piranha from being thrown back into the item pool, but despite that it was a solid weapon - hopefully getting fixed soon.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Farmer gains Harvesting per consumable picked up at full HP and also increases the end of round Harvesting bonus from 5% to 8%. Entrepreneur may not initially strike one as a part of the trio, but he reduces prices by 25% to buy more and scale faster while also increasing Harvesting bonuses by 50%! Yes, that's a huge chunk. And Baby reduces prices by another 20%, so we can buy even more, while also providing us with a total of 24 weapon slots, meaning 24 cursed gardens that at the same time increase in damage the more Harvesting we have. One Brotato I banished was Druid, just because Druid on his own is already insanely broken and the run would rather deviate away from being about Harvesting into being about just fruits, as you have a chance to gain Luck per fruit picked up. Which is crazy, don't get me wrong, but not really the goal of this.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The way it goes down is simple: As long as I am fighting or rather surviving on the stage, I have to blindfold myself. The moment the timer runs out and we get into the level-up screen and shopping phase, I can remove the blindfold to make proper decisions. While this run may make it look relatively simple, this was actually the 17th or 18th run I attempted. The main issue is that especially early on you die very quickly, 3 hits in succession can end the run immediately, especially with the randomness of bullets and dashing enemies.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor \n\u2735Dex' Discord: https://discord.gg/RMUDfuGdNG\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Initially I planned only 1 item, but in my mind that meant each turn I can use that item...for whatever reason. So once I realize that I add in a second item, going for the Syringe. The Syringe is an amazing weapon that scales up by 5 damage each time it's used, 10 when upgraded, but resets after each fight.

Before the run I did consider what I want to do, but the plan was rather rough: Get the magnetic claw combined with Count Clawcula, since that means we can do very quick and large grabs to attack. The lifesteal will keep as alive as long as we don't lose in a single big attack. On level ups I wanted to have at least 1 magnet, but the rest is just whatever metallic thing we can get that is not too big - the last thing we want to have is issues with big metallic weapons and the magnet, for example that it gets stuck or just due to size causes items to fall off.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Well, Baby can have up to 24 weapons, starting with 1 weapon and adding a slot for every level up you get - the big downside is that you require 130% additional experience for level ups.\nInitially I had big concerns since it's hard to get Engineering in the game and level ups are a major ressource for it, but on Baby the level ups are replaced with the additional weapon slots, meaning we have to get lucky in the shop. To my own surprise, the run turned out to be very simple on normal waves, though the Elites and final bossfight were huge issues. If someone gets proper items early enough, this should be a cakewalk, but without the level ups we also have big issues to build up HP and Armor, meaning it's also tough to survive.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

There is no way to gain more HP as all bonuses get negated, meaning you have to avoid hits at all cost. Usually, on dificulty 1, this is rather simple. Especially since his unlock requires a run to not get hit. But to give us a final tough challenge, I decided to go for difficulty 4 instead, where enemies are faster, deal more damage and have more HP.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479320/Pesticide_Not_Required/\n\n#pesticidenotrequired #autobattle #roguelike \n#gaming #DexTag",

The Gangster can steal an item from the shop without paying, but depending on the quality of the item that may summon an Elite. While dangerous, that also means we can get an additional red item every time we summon and defeat one, however an (ignored) issue is that each time one is summoned, they become stronger. In this particular run we got extremely lucky and ended up with all the crit related items to take the run to the next level.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The wording is complicated, but pretty much the simple meaning is that nothing that I pick up is allowed to inflict damage on the enemy: So no reflect, no poison, or anything that works in that way. For this I'll use Felina, since we can use her Cat to deal damage to the enemies. If you read this right now: Please let me know in a comment.

After we went extreme in the first episode, today we continue with a new fun thing I came across: Hydra Towers. The Hydra gives itself percentage bonus stats based on it's level, while when a Hydra gets defeated, an extra Hydra tower is added to the shop - and best of all, for each Hydra tower we have, the cost of them is reduced by 1, so they are eventually free. The real question is though: Just how insane can we turn the Hydra tower and how far can we get in Endless?\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116060/Epic_Auto_Towers/\n\n#epicautotowers #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

This doesn't sound as bad until you realize that Toastie has horrible stats, but the worst one being that Toastie has only 1 HP. And it really doesn't help that the starting weapon Peachone - as a solo weapon - is absolutely horrible to kickstart a run. Could it get any worse? Yes, the stage doesn't give you a starting Arcana, instead you need to get 100 kills and survive the rapidly increasing amount of enemies that spawn, and on top of that the enemy HP scaling also skyrockets fast, meaning initially you will get a bunch of kills, but that quickly drops down unless you make the perfect decisions.\n\nVS Mod used: https://www.nexusmods.com/vampiresurvivors/mods/87?tab=description\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

Cl4nk gets 1% Crit Chance per level up and starts with the Revolver, which is a very fun weapon that relies on projectiles and bounces. After an amazing first run that sent us flying I realize I never got the unlocks for the Luck, Difficulty (Curse) and XP Tomes, so I ended up going for a second run that turned out to be absurdely lucky. Now overall, I definitely need to balance damage and economy upgrades better, but I really feel like the Pistol is sadly just not good. Similar to other projectile weapons it can't attack fast enough to deal with the insane enemies in the lategame that are so fast they borderline break sound barriers.

Since the Lich is already about healing and starts with a bonus 10% Life Steal, our Sharp Tooth start with a bonus 5 damage. And that will also be needed, since the character only has a 50% Damage scaling - which only refers to the Damage% scaling, not to others like Melee Damage. And as expected, the build in sustain combined with the free extra damage leads to a very easy win - not the most insane win we ever had by far, but a very consistent and simple one.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

At first this doesn't sound that bad, but each character I attempted this with struggled at different points - mostly against some of the later waves, the Elite or the final boss fight, but for different reasons. Loud for example can build up a lot of Attack Speed, but most runs ended rather early since it becomes insanely difficult to survive the enemies without healing from material or buying armor and melee damage items. Another problem with these challenges is that I may have the best character but due to a few unlucky runs I stop playing them. Today I went for Vagabond for the first time after getting too frustrated that I always had a few good stats but others were completely lacking, ending in a loss - and Vagabond let's all weapons count as every class so you get max bonuses from each weapon class equipped. While this does compensate for a lack of general stats, it relies a ton on what weapons you find and what level up stats you get to round up your build.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The rules are straightforward: Hazard 5, no Artifacts, no Gold/Nitra purchases, which also includes the healing for 30 Gold or rolling. Initially I thought it would be a bit troublesome to just get the right weapons but wouldn't take that long, but it turned out quickly that missing out on the additional buffs quickly lead to the enemies overwhelming you. Even if just 5% of each wave stay alive due to the restrictions, after a couple of waves that means the entire stage will be filled.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/\n\n#deeprockgalactic #deeprockgalacticsurvivor #autobattler #roguelike \n#gaming #DexTag",

Meaning instead of just losing 33% Map Size, it's 3x33%. I'm not sure what the exact result for the map size is, either the game limits it or it's 1x0.67x0.67x0.67=30%, which sounds more reasonable (I made a math error in the video, when I said 13/14% I accidentally reduced it by 67% once, not 33%). As you can imagine, with such a tiny map the game becomes quite different - but more in an interesting way. Melee weapons become a lot more useful, but you will always have the enemies right in your face - and the -30% Speed loss from 3 times Old should also not be underestimated.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\nGmo2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3340744902\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

She starts with the weapon Blade Crossbow which evolves into BFC2000-AD (yes I'm not kidding), however the weapon has 2 interesting effects. The first one is that it has a divine intervention effect based on luck, or rather luck increases it's frequency, where a beam appears and she throws shurikens. But more interesting is what seems to be an extreme crit that has several multitudes. My theory is it's based on the enemy HP and less of a random range for crit, but so far I am uncertain.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor \n\u2735Dex' Discord: https://discord.gg/RMUDfuGdNG\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #contra #operationguns #roguelite #roguelike #gaming #DexTag",

Since there were a bunch of new Arcanas with the introduction of Darkasso we are able to take it to whole new extremes, however we are sadly more limited than it seems. Initially I planned to go for Bolero and did so, but since we need 2 scaling Arcanas as fast as possible, Bolero actually backfires and hurts us. With Inverse Mode we can guarantee to get 4 Arcanas, but with Bolero we are at the mercy of random spawns whether we will get them in time or not. To understand, we need Silent Old Sanctuary, Wicked Season and Boogaloo of Illusions. Meaning we could reset the stage until we spawn with 1 and reset until there is also one on the 1st minute, but that will take a huge amount of time to achieve and just for a chance at additional Arcanas. So I determined in this case it's not worth it and we will play it the regular way, but of course while also making use of the new Arcana Sapphire Mist, that allows us to multi-trigger weapons. It doesn't matter for Santa Water at all, pretty much, but our scaling will be way higher thanks to it, since it multi-triggers Paranormal Scan - each time giving us a random stat boost, of which we mostly look for Might.\n\nVS Mod used: https://www.nexusmods.com/vampiresurvivors/mods/87?tab=description\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

But it turns out you can also finish this quest with the right amount of luck.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/\n\n#deeprockgalactic #deeprockgalacticsurvivor #autobattler #roguelike \n#gaming #DexTag",

Another nice effect is that after the end of our turn, half the items get removed. They aren't gone and will drop in again, but the nice thing is that it pretty much reshuffles all the leftovers and also helps a lot with Magnets that got stuck.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor \n\u2735Dex' Discord: https://discord.gg/RMUDfuGdNG\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

So we combine a character that gains 1 Recovery every level, a weapon that creates a huge amount of chickens (which have their healing multiplied by recovery), a weapon that damages us to get the projectiles and Paranormal Scan, which gives overall stats but also heals - though main purpose is the stats, which also includes Magnet.

Reaching high damage numbers in Brotato is not hard to achieve if you go for Endless Mode, but the moment you get limited to just 20 waves you have way less options - and need way better RNG - to reach enough damage to one shot the bosses. How much? 33,206 Damage. So what's the plan? The rough plan is to get Obliterator as it's 1500% Ranged Damage scaling is the most absurd damage scaling on any weapon in the game, Cursed this can be up to 3150%. With a Crit that deals x2.3 damage, that goes up to 7245% Damage scaling, all of which lowers the Ranged Damage and %Damage requirement. So the plan is simple, but finding what you may as well call Exodia is what makes this so hard. Even if you find all the damage pieces, without enough economy you won't be able to get enough Ranged and %Damage, so a lot has to work out right.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The original form has no weapons from the very start, where I sell the starting weapon in the first shop right away. However, since this has failed for several months but was still excited to do one, I decided for a compromise that I can keep weapons until the boss fight and then have to take on it without weapons. Having that in mind I also don't focus on upgrading our weapon damage and instead preparing us for the fight, as well as Endless right after.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

I will state that I had far worse experiences with some other characters, but what makes him so horrible for me is that he takes the normal amount of RNG Brotato has (and it's quite high already) and multiplies that by a levels. My general strategy with him is to pick up as many items as possible that have a global effect, so something that would affect all weapons or help myself survive. I prefer killing over survivability, but this depends on what option I get. In this case I found the Sausage early on, so I knew we will always get value out of Elemental Damage, and that spiraled a bit out of control by assembling a perfect Turret build creation.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The Particle Accelerator is a very powerful weapon with infinite pierce that burns the enemies, but also 100% scaling on Elemental Damage and Engineering - both stats that synergize incredibly well with each other, since the Strange Book converts 1 Elemental Damage into 1 Engineering, giving Elemental Damage double value.

Over 5 games I had 5 10/0 games (10 wins, 0 losses) and 1 10/1 game. The reason it's so absurd is that your starting core is already strong compared to many other builds, the Chopper scales up the damage of all Axes. Once you get to Epic levels relatively easily due to the damage scaling, you can either look to further advance the build or if you can't find the pieces, pivot into another build while using the power of the axes to not lose fights.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players.

Yea I played quite a bit on my own and we do this here to farm up resources. But today I want to go for an endless run in the arena of Conquest Dark and attempt a theory I had for an immortal build. It relies on dodges - not dashes, those are a separate thing - as dodges avoid a normal hit on you. I say normal because I know of 2 exceptions, but we won't encounter these. Now that sounds fine and good, but we'd run out of dodge charges right? Wrong, that's where we use the Artifact Edge of Darkness, which has a 10% chance (affected by proc chance bonuses) to refill ALL of your dodge charges hit a single hit. So I want to focus on multi-attacks and attack speed on our primary weapon as much as possible that we can be as safe as possible.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238670/Conquest_Dark/\n\n#conquestdark #roguelike #bulletheaven #DexTag #gaming",

While we just explore the mod today and get to see a lot of different new ghost weapons, if you guys (and 5 gals) enjoy the mod, then we could go for a couple runs with a focus on 1 particular stacking weapon (and some bonus enemies just for more money and stacks of course...)\n\nGhost weapons: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2982161973\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

However, this time we pull out a full financial support, the kind of life support that would keep even the most lost cause alive - Moonlight Bolero forcing a starting Arcana, turning off Inverse Mode and going ham by getting an unreasonable amount of Arcanas. Moonlight Bolero, Silent Old Sanctuary, Wicked Season, Sapphire Mist, Heart of Fire, Jail of Crystal, Crystal Cries. Yes, you heard that right, a total of 7 Arcana were used here and it pains me to say that, but the Tri-Bracelet not only performed well, but it's performance was incredibely on the hard waves.\nOne thing that has to be stated though: In the past we used Inverse Mode to gain a 4th Arcana we would usually not have. The upside is that we scale faster and become stronger, but the 200% bonus HP on the enemies is no joke. Most weapons can deal with this until the hardcore waves appear, but with Moonlight Bolero and a decent amount of luck, this is not a requirement anymore to get an additional Arcana. However, the big downside is that 3 additional Arcana are needed to make it worth it - 1 to re-pay the investment of Moonlight Bolero, 1 to compensate for the loss of the 4th Arcana, and another 1 to actually have more Arcanas than without Moonlight Bolero. Since 1 can be forced in by resetting the game, \"only\" 2 additional Arcana are needed, however it is a gamble whether this actually happens and also when - since getting a growing Arcana at 25 minutes won't help anymore.\n\nVS Mod used: https://www.nexusmods.com/vampiresurvivors/mods/87?tab=description\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

The whole premis of the character is that you should avoid Tier 1 weapons and items, but Thief Daggers kind of play around that since you gain bonus material, which means you can buy and kill more, leading to higher levels and a faster ramp up in weapon levels. The bonus luck helps a lot to reach that point faster, but the main focus is on getting everything faster than you usually would.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The Cyborg has a 350% Ranged Damage multiplier, but converts it halfway in a 1:2 ratio into Engineering, which usually makes his ranged weapons - one of which being a Minigun he starts with - useless, however with the Nail we can still use the ridiculous Ranged Damage scaling. Math wise, each point of Ranged Damage is worth 3.5 Ranged Damage, which is then converted into 7 Engineering. 20% of that is then turned into weapon damage, so even at our weakest point we still get 1.4 Ranged Damage out of each point of Ranged Damage we pick up - and since the Minigun is one of if not the fastest firing weapon in the game, it can make perfect use of the stat.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The Captain gains 50% bonus XP Gain per empty weapon slot, but requires 200% additional XP to level up - in other words, you need to have 4 open weapon slots to not receive a penalty. The payoff for the struggle is that all the level up stats are doubled, so instead of 20% damage we would gain 40% damage if we find a legendary damage level up.

But I didn't realize yet that the main trickster is on it's way: Yorick. Not just 1, but 2.

While the start is very simple due to his high HP, HP Regeneration and Armor bonus, it is rather quickly noticed that the increasing enemy damage starts becoming a problem since you need to get hit to explode to kill enemies. Probably the best way by far to deal with that is the Blood Donation - an item that gives you 40 Harvesting, but more importantly deals 1 damage to you per second, meaning the explosion gets triggered without the need of running into enemies, though to burst down strong enemies it can still be done to trigger several explosions a second. We also find another favorite item of mine on him, the Handcuffs. If the goal is just to beat the game, then the Handcuffs are one of the best item on him as long as you determine that you already have enough HP, so the later you find it the better. While it locks your HP, it also gives you 24 damage stats, which the ability of Bull multiplies by 3 - so 72 - and is further increased by %Damage and %Explosion Damage bonuses.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Not...just reaching a high number, but literally making it impossible to continue and being forced to quit out of the game. How? I'd say it's best to watch the video, I tried to cut it short that everything is rather quickly revelead, but as a small tip: Multiplicative multipliers is the keyword. Additive multipliers are something like crit damage, where you deal x2 damage, if you increase that you can deal x3, x4, x5, the point is the actual multiplicative damage is being added on top of. But multiplicative multipliers go from x2 to x4 to x8 to x16 and so on.

The plan is quite simple: Crimson Shroud is the only retaliatory weapon in the game that ONLY has retaliatory damage, all other weapons have mixed attack forms, meaning these steal from each other. But this comes at a cost: We have to pick up 1 Health scaling item to evolve Laurel and Crimson Shroud is also a very slow start. And a newly discovered issue: Paranormal Scan keeps giving random stats, including Revivals, so it's actually very beneficial to keep the run going. Crimson Shroud however triggers the White Hand upon killing the Reaper, where you die back to back and can't move at all, meaning way less time to get more Revival stats.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

Like healing 100 HP/second but the enemy deals a maximum of 50 damage/second, you could last forever. If that's 100% the case I am not sure, but given what we reached I consider it beat and done.

The Elvish Orb gives +1 Multicast to an Elven item - permanently, not temporarly. For that it needs 12 seconds and that's the biggest issue, to either survive that long or to not kill the enemies prior to it triggering. And that's the real issue, even though it may sound nice to destroy the enemies, at one point you will get overpowered and die so fast that Elvish Orb also can't trigger, going into a cycle of repeated losses until the game is over. So the plan is simple: Get Lost Fragment below an optimally upgraded Elvish Orb so it will double trigger, giving +4 Multicast immediately, which is usually enough to win the game or at least to get very far.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players. Build deadly combos and scale exponentially.

You spawn in a randomly generated area and have to place down Crystals to mine out the surrounding area. Whenever a block is mined, an enemy spawns and wants to attack your Crystal, which is your base you have to protect. Enemies have 3 different types, indicated by their spawn area, and the game follows a simple rock-paper-scissor-principle, where a tower can deal 2x, 1x or 0.5x damage based on it's own and the enemy type. As we dig through the enemy blocks we also discover artifact fragments, once 5 are collected we get to choose an artifact. These will give the tower it's meant for a special effect, while the others receive an increase to their Gem amount - and Gems are what determine how strong an upgrade is for that tower. So eventually you have to decide if you want to give your main tower a special effect, or if you want to instead get one for another tower but it will give more gems to the main tower, which then upgrades all the other upgrades you have unlocked for it.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2307170/Everwarder/\n\n#everwarder #autobattler #towerdefense #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Little did I know that the game would immediately hook me, up to an extend I'd rather skip sleep to play more.\n\nIf you don't know PokeRogue, just imagine you play Pokemon but skip all the walking. Classic Mode has 200 stages and after each stage, you get to shop, balancing to maintain a healthy team but also not to run out of money. After every 10th stage you get fully healed, but before that either a Boss Pokemon or a Gym battle is waiting, having to carefully balance how much you need for a fight you don't know yet. But the biggest problem of it all: Ivy, your rival. Ivy starts off rather as a sleeper, rarely causing a loss, but she picks up a boss-equivalent Rayquaza that can wipe out entire teams on it's own.\n\nWhile you'd expect the hero of the story would be some very strong Pokemon or a smart abuse of game mechanics, it all came down to an easily forgotten friend.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor \n\u2735Dex' Discord: https://discord.gg/RMUDfuGdNG\n\u2735Game: https://pokerogue.net/\n\n#pokemon #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

At first this may seem like the same thing, but what that means is that bonus experience now has ridiculous impact. Prior, a 20% increase would mean you went from 300% experience gain to 320%, a tiny increase. Now a 20% increase means you go from 100% to 120%, but since we require only 1/3 of the XP to level up, it's worth 360% XP bonus.\nWe combine this with the Quarterstaff since it scales off of Level, gives bonus XP and also gives nice defensive bonuses - so I can fully focus on offensive values and farm the game.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Now each strategy or build has its own strengths and weaknesses, but it mostly depends what they are for - in this case, it's for Endless only, mostly since it's a bit difficult to get everything in time. Don't get me wrong, you can still beat Danger 5 Classic Brotato with it as shown here, but it's way harder than some other strategies. So what do we do? We spam turrets. Romantic has a chance to charm enemies with each hit he lands once they reach 25% HP - this also includes the damage turrets deal. So the plan is to get a ton of turrets with a ton of attack speed, proc Giant's Belt like stupid and then charm them to finish them off. That last part sounds a bit sus.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",
