The Elvish Orb gives +1 Multicast to an Elven item - permanently, not temporarly. For that it needs 12 seconds and that's the biggest issue, to either survive that long or to not kill the enemies prior to it triggering. And that's the real issue, even though it may sound nice to destroy the enemies, at one point you will get overpowered and die so fast that Elvish Orb also can't trigger, going into a cycle of repeated losses until the game is over. So the plan is simple: Get Lost Fragment below an optimally upgraded Elvish Orb so it will double trigger, giving +4 Multicast immediately, which is usually enough to win the game or at least to get very far.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players.

It would be too much to put everything in here, but how about: Bouncing enemy projectiles, 5 times the damage and no healing is dropped? Yea, that sounds quite insane and is just a small part of the package. This time I am not allowed to make use of the \"reroll banish exploit\", or how I would call it: Using our brain. The \"exploit\" allows you to banish everything you roll through at once, so you are left with mostly legendary and mythical upgrades. Jokes aside, this does make the run a lot harder and/or a lot more serious, so there is left space to goof around and it shows in the final boss fight.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One\n\u2022DLC on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900140/Bounty_of_One__Panic_in_the_Mines/\n\n#bountyofone #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

With the Elven Orb we stack a ton of multicast on it, but one thing is missing: actual damage. So we take the Elven book to increase it's damage AND we multicast said book to multiply the damage faster and faster. In the second run we go for a more typical multicast with the Lunar Codex, slap a bunch of potions on it and since it now has bleed, we can combine it with Shardfang - a legendary dagger that attacks whenever we apply bleed (which we do a ton per attack), and helps us deal a lot more damage until Warhorn kicks in and explodes the damage of Lunar Codex.\n\nOaken Tower is a synergy-heavy PvP autobattler where your tower of items fights other players.

While putting together the build I realize that our main weapon damage is going through the roof so I decided to fully go in on that and maximize it's damage potential. Needless to say this was a huge success as we pretty much one shot the final boss that spaws on the stage. This is then followed up by a round with the new character Sewvia, who is all about...sewing. After an initial failed attempt and with moral low, we end up creating a thunder god build that nukes everything everywhere on the stage - it took a bit longer to kill the boss though it was still surprisingly quick.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2137760/Crafty_Survivors/\n\n#craftysurvivors #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

At first this doesn't sound that bad, but each character I attempted this with struggled at different points - mostly against some of the later waves, the Elite or the final boss fight, but for different reasons. Loud for example can build up a lot of Attack Speed, but most runs ended rather early since it becomes insanely difficult to survive the enemies without healing from material or buying armor and melee damage items. Another problem with these challenges is that I may have the best character but due to a few unlucky runs I stop playing them. Today I went for Vagabond for the first time after getting too frustrated that I always had a few good stats but others were completely lacking, ending in a loss - and Vagabond let's all weapons count as every class so you get max bonuses from each weapon class equipped. While this does compensate for a lack of general stats, it relies a ton on what weapons you find and what level up stats you get to round up your build.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Ironically, the next run starts with the game giving me every possible survivability boost and once I approach the boss, not only do I luckily figure out how to deal with the special attack, but we are also turning into an unkillable heal god - and it should be mentioned that I take twice the damage while standing still and we still barely care.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2780710/Asgards_Fall__Viking_Survivors/\n\n00:00 First Run\n17:21 Main Run\n\n#asgardsfall #roguelike #bulletheaven #DexTag #gaming",

Reaching high damage numbers in Brotato is not hard to achieve if you go for Endless Mode, but the moment you get limited to just 20 waves you have way less options - and need way better RNG - to reach enough damage to one shot the bosses. How much? 33,206 Damage. So what's the plan? The rough plan is to get Obliterator as it's 1500% Ranged Damage scaling is the most absurd damage scaling on any weapon in the game, Cursed this can be up to 3150%. With a Crit that deals x2.3 damage, that goes up to 7245% Damage scaling, all of which lowers the Ranged Damage and %Damage requirement. So the plan is simple, but finding what you may as well call Exodia is what makes this so hard. Even if you find all the damage pieces, without enough economy you won't be able to get enough Ranged and %Damage, so a lot has to work out right.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Yea I played quite a bit on my own and we do this here to farm up resources. But today I want to go for an endless run in the arena of Conquest Dark and attempt a theory I had for an immortal build. It relies on dodges - not dashes, those are a separate thing - as dodges avoid a normal hit on you. I say normal because I know of 2 exceptions, but we won't encounter these. Now that sounds fine and good, but we'd run out of dodge charges right? Wrong, that's where we use the Artifact Edge of Darkness, which has a 10% chance (affected by proc chance bonuses) to refill ALL of your dodge charges hit a single hit. So I want to focus on multi-attacks and attack speed on our primary weapon as much as possible that we can be as safe as possible.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238670/Conquest_Dark/\n\n#conquestdark #roguelike #bulletheaven #DexTag #gaming",

Select your class and fight through thousands of enemies while carefully upgrading skills and bonuses.

Perfect your builds through Dark Ritual runs that will decide humanity's future as you battle endless hordes across haunting ruins and cursed kingdoms.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238670/Conquest_Dark/\n\n#conquestdark #roguelike #bulletheaven #DexTag #gaming",

Or maybe that it's just a better execution of what Minecraft Legends tried to be...The game in it's core is relatively simple: Farm up basic resources, build defenses, destroy enemies and protect the king. Each round you earn currency to get more unlocks and you have to decide how greedy you can afford to be, as going too much for economy may end up in the fragile king's death.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2086680/Castle_Craft/\n\n#castlecraft #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

Not...just reaching a high number, but literally making it impossible to continue and being forced to quit out of the game. How? I'd say it's best to watch the video, I tried to cut it short that everything is rather quickly revelead, but as a small tip: Multiplicative multipliers is the keyword. Additive multipliers are something like crit damage, where you deal x2 damage, if you increase that you can deal x3, x4, x5, the point is the actual multiplicative damage is being added on top of. But multiplicative multipliers go from x2 to x4 to x8 to x16 and so on. So if you find a way to trigger these often enough, it gets ridiculous VERY fast.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356780/Dungeon_Clawler/\n\n#dungeonclawler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Now I define a win as getting to 0 minutes since this then spawns the endless waves, meaning you made it through the game and are now on a timer to die. That said, if you think a win would be a boss kill, I totally understand that - and the main reason I didn't even mention that in the video is that I simply haven't thought about it, since you can do the boss kill at any point or even never, but hitting 0 is always guaranteed to happen. So for me the boss is rather an additional thing. To say this challenge was tough would be an understatement and when you see the winning run you'll understand what was needed to get there. Pretty much 3 things had to work out, 2 of those just at the right moment.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/\n\n#megabonk #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

While the DLC \"only\" contains 21 Unlocks, there were also a few more that came up from Vampire Survivors itself due to updates over time - meaning today we will also unlock the secret character Bats, finish the 2 adventures World of Light and Dark and A Garlic Paradise, and also unlock the Darkasso Relic in Room 1665 with all 5 of them collected.\nLegacy of the Moonspell takes us into a fantasy world full of magic and monsters as we have to fight through a rather tough but ginormous map you can easily get lost in. While it can be seen that the oldest DLC lacks a bit in comparison to newer ones, it should be kept in mind that it's dirt-cheap at only $2 and for that is 100% worth it's value.\nThe DLC contains the new characters Miang Moonspell, Menya Moonspell, Syuuto Moonspell, Babi-Onna, McCoy-Oni, Megalo Menya and Syuuto Moonspell, as well as Gav'et-Oni. \n\n00:00:00 Legacy of the Moonspell\n01:53:37 More Unlocks\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors\n\n#vampiresurvivor #vampiresurvivors #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

Farmer gains Harvesting per consumable picked up at full HP and also increases the end of round Harvesting bonus from 5% to 8%. Entrepreneur may not initially strike one as a part of the trio, but he reduces prices by 25% to buy more and scale faster while also increasing Harvesting bonuses by 50%! Yes, that's a huge chunk. And Baby reduces prices by another 20%, so we can buy even more, while also providing us with a total of 24 weapon slots, meaning 24 cursed gardens that at the same time increase in damage the more Harvesting we have. One Brotato I banished was Druid, just because Druid on his own is already insanely broken and the run would rather deviate away from being about Harvesting into being about just fruits, as you have a chance to gain Luck per fruit picked up. Which is crazy, don't get me wrong, but not really the goal of this.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

That said, just because that can be done doesn't change that much. As in yes, you can reset for what you want if it's there, but the game highly limits what's available.

Now if you ask me \"Dex, do you think the Fox is the best now?\" I would 100% say: No, we got carried hard by having the damage multipliers and it would have been so much better if we had 100% Crit Chance, instead of the low amount we had. That said though, I think it's still incredible that the character you start with and is arguably the worst out of all is right now the one that holds my highscore - and got me into the top 200.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/\n\n#megabonk #roguelite #roguelike \n#update #gaming #DexTag",

Cl4nk gets 1% Crit Chance per level up and starts with the Revolver, which is a very fun weapon that relies on projectiles and bounces. After an amazing first run that sent us flying I realize I never got the unlocks for the Luck, Difficulty (Curse) and XP Tomes, so I ended up going for a second run that turned out to be absurdely lucky. Now overall, I definitely need to balance damage and economy upgrades better, but I really feel like the Pistol is sadly just not good. Similar to other projectile weapons it can't attack fast enough to deal with the insane enemies in the lategame that are so fast they borderline break sound barriers.

Demon is still very strong, but falls short scaling wise the further you go. Druid on the other hand can increase his damage so ridiculously high with multiplicatively scaling - he makes use of the items that scale with the constantly increasing Luck, so their base damage goes up, but then also converts Luck into %Damage. In our case we went crazy and hit 52% Damage per 10 Luck, or in other words 52 Pearls worth of Cursed Pearls.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

      "description": "Today we are back with some more Balatro - this time it's a bit different though, since I didn't intent to even record. Initially the run was just a random fun run where I got 4 retrigger on the first card played, so e.g. a +3 Gold card now gets triggered 5 times, giving 15 Gold instead.  But I didn't realize yet that the main trickster is on it's way: Yorick. Not just 1, but 2. Yorick multiplies the multiplier, which increases by 1 every 23 discards - meaning now every 23 discards we increase it twice by 1. And since they multiply each other as well, it's a lot crazier.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/\n\n#balatro #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Thanks to you guys we figured out 2 crucial elements of the game, for starters as long as nothing is chosen in the starter sheriff chest, I can just alt+F4 to start a new run that still has the chest - usually you have to beat the first Sheriff and quit out to get it. This makes resetting for the right starting object WAY faster. Second, and more importantly, one of you has figured out that rolling and then banishing all choices does not just banish the current choices, but also the ones we rolled over. So if the stars align and we (finally, because this took several tries) get just the right rolls to banish the things we don't want, we are just left with insane mythical upgrades.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One\n\u2022DLC on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900140/Bounty_of_One__Panic_in_the_Mines/\n\n#bountyofone #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Don't get me wrong, you can still beat Danger 5 Classic Brotato with it as shown here, but it's way harder than some other strategies. So what do we do? We spam turrets. Romantic has a chance to charm enemies with each hit he lands once they reach 25% HP - this also includes the damage turrets deal. So the plan is to get a ton of turrets with a ton of attack speed, proc Giant's Belt like stupid and then charm them to finish them off.

You spawn in a randomly generated area and have to place down Crystals to mine out the surrounding area. Whenever a block is mined, an enemy spawns and wants to attack your Crystal, which is your base you have to protect. Enemies have 3 different types, indicated by their spawn area, and the game follows a simple rock-paper-scissor-principle, where a tower can deal 2x, 1x or 0.5x damage based on it's own and the enemy type. As we dig through the enemy blocks we also discover artifact fragments, once 5 are collected we get to choose an artifact. These will give the tower it's meant for a special effect, while the others receive an increase to their Gem amount - and Gems are what determine how strong an upgrade is for that tower. So eventually you have to decide if you want to give your main tower a special effect, or if you want to instead get one for another tower but it will give more gems to the main tower, which then upgrades all the other upgrades you have unlocked for it.\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2307170/Everwarder/\n\n#everwarder #autobattler #towerdefense #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

While I'd say it was overall smooth, without certain big jumps in Engineering due to insane items, it could have been a very different run. But since this is Dex and that means we get stupid item luck, we casually come across the HIGHEST Engineering item in the entire game, instantly cursed. Oh, and of course also 2 instantly cursed weapons with a high curse level.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

Not that we could though since we only deal 1 damage and with our insanely negative %Damage, there is also no fast way to change that. While playing I got quite surprised how the run felt quite good, like a normal character would. It's pretty much just a Pacifist run but removes a lot of frustration and replaces it with fun. The map is bigger and a minigame is added to avoid all trees. Once enough spawned, the additional healing from Cryptid (3 HP Regeneration per Tree) keeps us alive. But there is a tipping point - the Giants Belt. This must be one of the most hilarious things I personally experienced in Brotato, seeing our weapon deal a miniscule amount of damage but slapping the enemies out of existence due to the Giants Belt effect.\n\nDmgMeter: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358859974\nMore UI 2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3359801812\nNo Explosion Smoke: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300601447\nBetter Display: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991102498\nImproved Tooltips: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689\nGmo2: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3340744902\n\n\u2735Support me and my channel with a tip: https://streamlabs.com/dexcitinggaming/tip\n\u2735Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz9boSY06_KXeVrAv70qysA/join\n\u2735Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/DexSurvivor\n\u2735Game on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/\n\n#brotato #autobattler #roguelike #DexTag #gaming",

The Hydra gives itself percentage bonus stats based on it's level, while when a Hydra gets defeated, an extra Hydra tower is added to the shop - and best of all, for each Hydra tower we have, the cost of them is reduced by 1, so they are eventually free.

I'm not sure what the exact result for the map size is, either the game limits it or it's 1x0.67x0.67x0.67=30%, which sounds more reasonable (I made a math error in the video, when I said 13/14% I accidentally reduced it by 67% once, not 33%). As you can imagine, with such a tiny map the game becomes quite different - but more in an interesting way.
