- [ ] Test touch interaction patterns

### Filter State Visualization
- [ ] Create `AppliedFilters.vue` component with removable chips
- [ ] Implement live result count updates
- [ ] Add filter complexity indicators
- [ ] Create loading states for filter application
- [ ] Add filter summary text generation

## Phase 2: Advanced Discovery Features (4-6 weeks)

### Price Range Filtering
- [ ] Create `PriceFilter.vue` with range slider
- [ ] Add price preset buttons (Free, Under $10, $10-$30, etc.)
- [ ] Handle multiple currency support (EUR/USD)
- [ ] Update database queries for price filtering

### Enhanced Time Controls
- [ ] Implement custom date range picker with validation
- [ ] Add "Recently Released" smart filter (last 30 days from release)

- [ ] Add "New Discoveries" filter (first video coverage recently)

### Advanced Sorting
