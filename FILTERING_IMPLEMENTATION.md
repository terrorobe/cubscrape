- [x] Update SQL query for multi-channel filtering
- [x] Add channel statistics display (game count per channel)

### Time-Based Filtering
- [x] Create `TimeFilter.vue` component with preset buttons
- [x] Implement "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", "Last 90 days" presets
- [x] Add "This year", "All time" options
- [x] Create custom date range picker component
- [x] Update database queries for video age filtering
- [x] Add release date range filtering

- [x] Implement swipe gestures for modal interaction
- [x] Create tabbed filter organization for mobile
- [x] Add horizontal scrolling applied filters bar
- [x] Ensure 44px minimum touch targets
- [x] Test touch interaction patterns

### Filter State Visualization
- [x] Create `AppliedFilters.vue` component with removable chips
- [x] Implement live result count updates
- [x] Add filter complexity indicators
- [x] Create loading states for filter application
- [x] Add filter summary text generation

## Phase 2: Advanced Discovery Features (4-6 weeks)

### Price Range Filtering
- [x] Create `PriceFilter.vue` with range slider
- [x] Add price preset buttons (Free, Under $10, $10-$30, etc.)
- [x] Handle multiple currency support (EUR/USD)
- [x] Update database queries for price filtering

### Enhanced Time Controls
- [x] Implement custom date range picker with validation
- [x] Add "Recently Released" smart filter (last 30 days from release)
- [x] Create "Trending" detection (multiple videos in recent timeframe)
- [x] Add "New Discoveries" filter (first video coverage recently)

### Advanced Sorting
- [x] Create `SortingOptions.vue` with multiple criteria
- [x] Add sorting by video recency + rating combination
- [x] Implement "Best Value" sorting (rating vs price)
- [x] Add "Most Covered" sorting (video count)

### ~~Filter Presets & Saved Searches~~ (Removed)
- ~~Create `FilterPresets.vue` component~~
- ~~Implement preset saving to localStorage~~
- ~~Add popular preset suggestions~~
- ~~Create preset sharing via URL~~

## Phase 3: Intelligence & Advanced Features (6-8 weeks)

### Smart Discovery Features
- ~~Implement "Trending This Week" algorithm~~ (Requires complex data modeling)
- ~~Create "Rising Games" detection (increasing video coverage)~~ (Requires complex data modeling)
- [x] Add "Cross-Platform Available" filtering
- [x] Create "Hidden Gems" smart detection

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Implement debounced filter updates
- [x] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [x] Add progressive loading for filter options

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### Database & Backend
- [x] Clean up currency fields in database to be purely numeric (remove currency symbols, text)
- [x] Review and optimize database indexes for new queries

### Component Architecture
- [x] Create reusable filter component library
- [x] Implement consistent design system tokens

### State Management
- [x] Implement centralized filter state with Pinia/Vuex
- [x] Add URL state synchronization for all new filters
- [x] Create filter state persistence layer
